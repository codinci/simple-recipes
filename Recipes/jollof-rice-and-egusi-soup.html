        <h3>Jollof Rice</h3>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1/3 cup pure groundnut oil (a substitute for vegetable oil)</li>
            <li>1/4 of a large onion (sliced)</li>
            <li>1 small can tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 Maggi stock cubes</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon each of thyme, curry powder, chili powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>4 bay leaves</li>
            <li>2.5 cups basmati rice</li>
            <li>Sheet of foil</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h4>Recipe Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a pot with a tight-fitting lead on medium heat and heat up the oil in it. 
                Add the chopped onions and fry until they’ve browned.
            </li>
            <li>Then add in the tomato paste; fry the onions and paste for 3 minutes. 
                Then add in the Maggi cubes, thyme, curry, chilli powder and salt, and combine.
            </li>
            <li>Add 2.5 cups of water and the bay leaves to the pot. Cover and bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to minimum.  Add in the rice. Cover the pot with the foil and then the lid.
                 (It’s extremely important that the pot is well covered as we are trying to infuse each grain of rice.)
            </li>
            <li>Leave to cook on minimum heat for 35 minutes.</li>
            <li>Remove the pot from heat and stir the contents. If the texture of the rice isn’t to your 
                liking at this point, simply cover the pot tightly for another 6 minutes.
                 (There is no need to return the pot back to the heat, the retained heat is enough to
                 continue to cook the rice).
                 Otherwise the rice is ready to serve.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the bay leafs and serve the  jollof rice with your choice of protein.</li>
        </ol>
